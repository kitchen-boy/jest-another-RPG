# DESCRIPTION
* Create a command-line role-playing game (RPG) in which a user battles against a series of enemies whose health and stats can be sustained by a potion.

## TASK COMPLETED

# USER STORY


# ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
The solution must meet the following four criteria:

1. Create an RPG and organize the code by player objects, enemy objects, and potion objects.

2. The three main objects should have tests written for them.

3. A fourth Game object encompasses all of the game logic.

4. The game can be played in the command line based on user input.

# INSTALLATION SETUP

# FEATURES:
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a popular programming paradigm in which code is organized around objects instead of functions. This approach has the added advantage of helping us follow DRY practices.

Test-driven development (TDD) is the practice of writing tests before writing code. Here's a snapshot of the TDD process:
1. Write a failing test before writing any code.
2. Write the minimal amount of code necessary to make the test pass.
3. Refactor the code.
